This is a Quiz Game that I've built in C# that you can play and have fun with it. The interesting part is that you can change the questions and answers with your own, meaning you can just copy the model and use it for any project you want.

How to add a question: In the (string[] answer) box, add any new answer you want, however after that, remember to add the answer in the other string box below. Then, you can form the question and give it a value. To edit a question, simply edit the question text and answer.

Have fun and thank you for reading!

Quiz planned to come to C++, Java, and Python.
